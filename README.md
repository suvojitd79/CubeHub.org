### Why someone might try this website

In a nutshell, solving a Rubik's cube without any help could be challenging that takes a mixture of skill and passion for anyone to solve the cube on their own. On the other hand, many of us have solved it by themselves and they have created their own logic. This website could be used as an interface between people who have solved this earlier and absolute beginners.
